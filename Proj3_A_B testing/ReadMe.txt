For this project, I have worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

I did this in 3 steps:

1.) Probablity tests:
I calculated probablity for different conversion and found the rate of conversion i.e pold and pnew

2.)A/B Testing
My hypothesis is

null hypothesis= pold-pnew>=0 
alternative hypothesis=pold-pnew<0

Type1 error rate is considered at 5%

3.)Regression approach

In here Logistic Regression is used. to verify the results obtained from A/B testing
